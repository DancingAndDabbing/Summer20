title: 'Body Keypoints'
---

In PoseNet, the human body is represented as a set of "keypoints" which are either joints (e.g., leftWrist, rightKnee) or parts of the face (e.g., nose, leftEye). Most of the time, you will refer to the body keypoints by their names in the table below.

Notice that the first part of each keypoint name (usually "left" or "right", with the exception of "nose") is in lowercase, and the second part starts in uppercase. You need to match the case when you use these keypoints, otherwise they won't work.

It is also useful to note that keypoint data are always organized in the same order in something called an "array". The first position in the array (which many computer languages, including Javascript, refer to as position 0) is for the nose. The next position (also called "index" 1 in the array) is the left eye, and so on. There are 17 keypoints in the table, but since the the indexing starts at 0, the highest value is 16.
