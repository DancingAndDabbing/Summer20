title: From nothing to something

The raw materials for this environment will be a video that we load (or obtain from the webcam) and the code window on the left.

The code can't be empty, or you'll get an error. (Try to delete it and see).
At the minimum, you need to declare an empty relationship with inputs and outputs.

Good computer programmers use comments to explain what they are doing with code.
## Code Example

```js
() => []

// comments are preceded by two slashes
// our reactive environment has inputs and outputs
// later we will put inputs in between (parentheses) above
// and outputs in between the square brackets

```

## Imagine, a circle


```js
() => [{
  what: "circle"
}]

```

To create somthing, we need to first decide what it is. Also, a little bit of syntax here. Because we can have more than one thing, we need to use {curly braces} even if we only have one thing. What's our one thing? A circle. Why is it popping all over the screen? Because we only said what. We didn't say where...
