## Code Example

```js
(pose) => [
// Name: Viva! Effect.
// What: Make the word "Viva!" appear on the dancer's hands when they are over her head.
// Why: I like the power/vitality that I feel when the dancer pushes her arms up!
// How (choices): I wanted the word to follow whichever hand is higher, and I didn't
// want it to appear unless her arms are goign really high.
// Not when she puts her wrist to her forehead.
    {
        what: "text",
        where: {
            x: (pose.rightWrist.x + pose.leftWrist.x)/2,
            y: min(pose.rightWrist.y, pose.leftWrist.y)
        },
        when: (pose.leftWrist.y < pose.nose.y - 20 |
                pose.rightWrist.y < pose.nose.y - 20) ,
        how: {
            str: 'Viva!', // str means string - a term for text
            textSize: 64,
        }
    }
];


```
